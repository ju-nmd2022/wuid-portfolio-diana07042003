<h2> Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hello!
    My name is Diana Man, I am 19 years old and I am from a small town in the north of Romania. I arrived in Sweden in august and since then I am a full time student at the Jonkoping University.
</p>
<h3>Why did I choose NMD?</h3>
<p2> I have choose the New Media Design degree since it is a program with multiple courses that are great for me and my future career. The moment that my eyes crossed the courses during this 3-years program, I knew I had to apply and hope that I would eventually be accepted. Until now, I can say that I am really enjoy attending the courses and learning new things almost everyday. </p2>
<h4>Hobbies?</h4>
<p3>Unfortunately, I don't really have a lot of hobbies, I enjoy doing simple activites, but for about a year now I started attending some painting classes. This I consider to be my main hobby at this moment and I really enjoy doing as it is relaxing and a pleasant way to spend my free time. Apart from that, I like spending some quality time with my family, keeping up with what is going on in our lives and enjoying each others company for as long as we can.</p3>
